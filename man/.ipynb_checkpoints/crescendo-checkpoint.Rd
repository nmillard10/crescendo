\arguments{
\item{Ycounts}{A matrix containing un-normalized gene count information (cells x genes).}

\item{meta_data}{Metadata table that contains cell information (cell x info).}

\item{R}{A matrix containing cluster assignments for each cell (cluster x cell).}

\item{genes_use}{Genes to estimate. If none supplied, will automatically estimate all genes in Ycounts.}

\item{id_col}{Name of column containing unique cell IDs.}

\item{batch_col}{Name of column containing batch information (e.g. batch, dataset, technology).}

\item{prop}{Fraction of cells to downsample to (e.g. 0.5 means downsample to arouond 50% of original cells, 0.25 means 25%, etc.).}

\item{min_cells}{Number of minimum cells to keep from each cell type in each batch.}

\item{constant_umi}{Determines whether to sample counts at a constant UMI level vs. variable (recommended to be constant).}

\item{merge_clusters}{Determines whether to merge redundant Harmony clusters (merging decreases computational costs).}

\item{lambda}{Regularization parameter.}

\item{alpha}{Elastic net regularization parameter. 1 indicates lasso penalty, 0 indicates ridge penalty.}

\item{seed}{Seed for RNG.}

\item{return_obj}{Return only corrected counts, or results from each step.}

\item{mc.cores}{Number of cores to use for sampling (useful for large datasets).}

\item{impute_reads}{If not NULL, supply a vector of UMI to perform gene imputation in a higher UMI context than observed in the data.}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing corrected gene count expressions, or a list containing results from each Crescendo step.
}
\description{
Runs the Crescendo algorithm by performing the downsampling (if necessary), estiimation, marginalization, and matching steps.
