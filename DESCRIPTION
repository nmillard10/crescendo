Description: Investigators often encounter confounding factors in the gene expression of their single-cell data that include 
    artificial differences exhibited across batches, samples, technologies, datasets, and modalities. In order to integrate 
    their data across these confounding factors, computational analysts typically use integration algorithms that operate in a 
    lower-dimensional space, but don't directly correct gene expression. Cresecendo allows users to integrate their data by 
    directly correcting gene expression; this may benefit investigators that want to visualize gene expression in their data,
    with a particular benefit in spatial transcriptomics contexts.
